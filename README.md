**SKYHAWK Recovery Project (SHRP)**

Updated SHRP 12.1 branch for Motorola Edge 30 Ultra (eqs) recovery development.

This fork has been done to help development of a SHRP release for eqs device since original 12.1 branch is no longer developed and not suitable to obtain a working device decryption.

Needed TWRP updates will eventually committed here.
